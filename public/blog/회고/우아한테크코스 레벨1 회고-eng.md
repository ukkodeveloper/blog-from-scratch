summary: The two months I spent on UTEK Level 1 flew by. “I learned a lot” is an understatement. There were moments of inspiration, frustration, joy, and feeling overwhelmed. After a whirlwind two months, I was given a week off to pause and reflect on where I’ve been and to think about how to make the most of Level 2.

## Getting Started

The two months I spent on Level 1 of UTEK flew by. “I learned a lot” is an understatement. There were moments of inspiration, frustration, joy, and feeling overwhelmed. After a whirlwind of activity that felt like it swallowed me whole, I've been given a week to pause and reflect on where I’ve been and to think about how to make the most of Level 2. I'm naturally not an optimist, so in this piece, I’ll mostly talk about areas that I feel I still lack.

## How to Fish For Yourself

“Learn how to fish for yourself.” It's a phrase that haunted me toward the end of Level 1. It's one of those things that any developer is supposed to be able to do, but it's also something I feel I lack more than anything.

I've always had difficulty with reading comprehension and understanding, so I had a hard time learning new things on my own through Google. In the past, when I encountered something I had no clue about, I would try to watch YouTube videos to get a basic understanding. But this isn’t what it means to fish for yourself. I tried to break this pattern and make an effort to learn things through Google searches alone, without watching videos.

It wasn't easy. It was especially difficult not to compare myself to others and feel inadequate when I couldn't learn at their pace. I ended up talking this through with my mentor, and it was a huge help. Her advice to me can be summarized as 1) Define the exact problem you're facing, and 2) Don't focus on finding information that matches your situation exactly; widen your search parameters, and (if you can) search in English to find better quality information. However, the crux of the problem was that **I was too focused on doing everything ‘on my own’**. My friend Junhee had this to say to me: “I work for a detergent company, so I often read blog posts about how to remove kimchi stains. But if you read those posts, you wouldn’t understand anything, right?” He’s right. No matter how many blog posts I read about removing kimchi stains, I wouldn't be able to understand the underlying principles.

The truth is that while I have a hard time learning new things, what I really have a hard time with is learning “new information”. This probably means that compared to other crews, my comprehension is poor because my foundations are weak. When I get stuck and can’t fish for myself, it’s okay to ask for help from those around me.

My friend Junhee and my mentor were saying the same thing. Just like my mentor told me to schedule time to think and ask questions about things I don't understand, Junhee also told me that it's important to learn quickly from the people around me.

## Fear of the New

Throughout the two months of study, I didn't notice that I had a fear of new things. When I was doing my level interview and reviewing previous concepts, I realized I had more gaps in my knowledge than I thought. I thought I had tried various things, but I realized that most of my experience was in areas I enjoy, such as object-oriented design, encapsulation, and separation of roles. On the other hand, things I used to be afraid of such as the development environment and git were still full of things I didn't know.

I thought about why I was afraid of new things. The first reason is probably the fear of failure, and the second reason is probably because I have a hard time learning new concepts.

I was talking to a friend recently and he said this to me: “If you search the internet, you’ll eventually figure out how to do anything, right?” That’s true. Everyone learns at their own pace, so there’s no guarantee that I won’t be able to learn something. I think I considered every new thing I learned as a time for self-assessment.

If I mustered the courage to take that first step, I might be willing to make some sacrifices. In order to do that, I need to set priorities and make a point of tracking my progress without putting things off. The inspiration and knowledge I’m feeling now aren’t going to last forever.

## In Conclusion

After a whirlwind two months, I took a minute to think about “what made me so anxious?” I came to learn something new called development, but every moment felt like a continuous stream of pair programming exercises.

While studying with others, I also found myself **comparing** myself to those around me. There were times when I felt like I wasn’t improving, even though I felt like I was working hard, and there were also times when I envied the abilities of others.

Now I have a better idea of how to cope. I realized it’s more embarrassing to let others see me being anxious than to show them my weaknesses. Part of it might be brazening it out and approaching missions with positivity. First, I thought I had to approach things with positivity in order to communicate and make decisions constructively.
