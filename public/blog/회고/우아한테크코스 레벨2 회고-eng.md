After two months, the Career Track 2 at Woowa Tech School curriculum has come to an end. I've completed three missions, and it's been a series of acquiring new knowledge and applying new technologies. In retrospect, it's amazing to think that in just two months, I've worked with React, styled-components, Storybook, npm deployment, Recoil, msw, and more. I was engrossed the entire time, which allowed me to learn a lot.

I learned a lot about the technical aspects, but my greatest achievement was learning how to approach learning in a healthy way. And in developing a healthy learning process, the method of "learning in small units" played a major role. This reduced my anxiety, allowed me to concentrate on the task at hand, and helped me to be more effective in my learning. We called this "TDD-style learning."

## What is TDD-style learning?

TDD stands for 'Test Driven Development', and it involves testing code in short cycles. TDD-style learning is the application of the core value of TDD — receiving feedback on code through testing in short cycles — to the learning process.

The routine for TDD-style learning is as follows:

1️⃣ Decide what you will learn in 40 minutes and share it.

There are some things to check when setting goals. First, 'is the probability of completing the goal within 40 minutes over 80%?' If the goal is unlikely to be achieved within 40 minutes, it needs to be revised. 40 minutes is shorter than you might think. Therefore, if you are not used to studying with a set time limit, it is key to lower your expectations and set a less ambitious goal.

Second, 'are there any bottlenecks that could cause unexpected delays?' For example, let's say you are studying to apply React useRef. To achieve your goal, you need to focus on learning the purpose and usage of useRef. However, during the process, you might become curious about the differences between 'virtual DOM' and 'real DOM'. Of course, it is important to study this in depth, but for the current goal, it is a distracting bottleneck. Therefore, you need to try to predict these bottlenecks and decide how to control them to allow you to focus on applying useRef.

2️⃣ Study for 40 minutes.

The key to studying is to stay on course. This is not as difficult as it might sound, since you have already set a clear goal and thought about how to control any factors that might prevent you from achieving it. However, achieving your goal is a separate issue from staying on course.

3️⃣ Reflect on what you have learned.

Check how much of the goal you set for yourself you achieved. In some cases, you may exceed 100% achievement because you set the goal too low. In other cases, the learning content may be difficult, and you may achieve less than 50%. The important thing is to reflect on how to achieve your goal in the future and how to manage bottlenecks the next time. This feedback allows for better learning in the next cycle.

## Advantages of quick feedback

Feedback in such short units has many advantages.

First, it facilitates metacognition about learning. In development, there are times when you feel like you've been working hard all day but are unsure of what you have actually accomplished. Tracking your learning by recording and sharing it can help with this.

Second, it allows you to carry out your studies and work based on your priorities. Since you set goals every hour, you can deal with the most urgent tasks first.

Third, it causes you to think about time-consuming tasks in smaller units. Previously, I would begin studying by thinking that I had to read the React documentation. In contrast, with TDD-style learning, you set small, specific goals. For example, within the React documentation, you might set a goal to understand the key points of useEffect and to implement two or three key examples.

## Changes I experienced

Since applying the TDD-style learning method with my crew, it has greatly benefitted not only my studies but my overall Woowa Tech School experience. Most of all, I feel like I am learning in a healthy way. I now spend more time concentrating on myself rather than comparing myself with others. I feel a great sense of accomplishment for what I have done today.

In addition, the people who study TDD-style are really passionate and mentally healthy members of the crew, and I learn a lot from them. I can observe how others learn and pick up good methods. And because of their passion, I am motivated to work hard as well.

At the beginning of Career Track 2, coding seemed more difficult than it was enjoyable. My only thought was to somehow survive. In that respect, I feel incredibly lucky to have come across TDD-style learning. I've moved beyond just learning and have become able to code with joy. I am always grateful to Coach Jun who first introduced the TDD method to the crew and who has given a number of seminars, and to my fellow TDD learners, who are currently studying TDD together with me. My goal for Career Track 3 is to break things down into smaller units and have a sense of accomplishment.
