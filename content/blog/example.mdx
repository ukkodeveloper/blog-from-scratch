## Introduction

Welcome to the release of Tailwind `Nextjs` Starter Blog template v2.0. This release is a major
refactor of the codebase to support Nextjs App directory and React Server Components. Read on to discover the new features and how to migrate from V1.

The template was first released in January 2021 and has since been used by thousands of users. It is featured on [Next.js Templates](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog), [Tailwind Awesome](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/resources/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) among other listing sites. It attracts 200+ unique visitors daily notching 1500-2000 page views, with 1.3k forks and many other clones.

Many thanks to the community of users and contributors for making this template a success! I created a small video montage of the blogs (while cleaning up the list in the readme) to showcase the diversity of the blogs created using the template and to celebrate the milestone:

Version 2 builds on the success of the previous version and introduces many new features and improvements. The codebase has been refactored to support Next.js App directory and React Server Components. Markdown / MDX is now processed using Contentlayer, a type-safe content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data. It integrates with Pliny, a new library that provides out of the box Next.js components to enhance your static site with analytics, comments and newsletter subscription. A new command palette (⌘-k) search component is also added to the template.

Let's dive into the new features and improvements in V2.

## Next.js App Directory and React Server Components

Now that [Next.js App router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) is finally stable and is mostly feature compatible with Page Router, the codebase has been migrated to new setup. This allows for a hybrid rendering approach, with the use of React Server Components generated on the server side for faster page loads and smaller bundle sizes, while retaining the ability to sprinkle in client side React components for interactivity.[^1]

With addition powers comes a [new paradigm](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials) to learn. I have migrated the codebase to make use of the new features as much as possible. This includes changes in the folder structure, splitting components into server vs client components, leveraging server side data fetching and using the recommended [Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) API for SEO discoverability.

While this simplifies the codebase to some extent, it makes migration from the old codebase more difficult. If you are looking to migrate, I recommend starting from a fresh template and copying over your customizations and existing content. See the [migration recommendations](#migration-recommendations) section for more details.

## Typescript First

The codebase has been migrated to Typescript. While the previous version of the template was available in both Javascript and Typescript, I decided to reduce the maintenance burden and focus on Typescript. This also allows for better type checking and code completion in IDEs.

Typescript is also a perfect match with our new type-safe markdown processor - Contentlayer.

## Contentlayer

[Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) is a content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data that you can easily import into your application. It makes working with local markdown or MDX files a breeze. This replaces `MDX-bundler` and our own markdown processing workflow.

First, a content source is defined, specifiying the name of the document type, the source where it is located along with the frontmatter fields and any additional computed fields that should be generated as part of the process.

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
export const Blog = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Blog',
  filePathPattern: 'blog/**/*.mdx',
  contentType: 'mdx',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    date: { type: 'date', required: true },
    tags: { type: 'list', of: { type: 'string' }, default: [] },
    ...
  },
  computedFields: {
    readingTime: { type: 'json', resolve: (doc) => readingTime(doc.body.raw) },
    slug: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.flattenedPath.replace(/^.+?(\/)/, ''),
    }
    ...
  },
}))
```

Contentlayer then processes the MDX files with our desired markdown remark or rehype plugins, validates the schema, generate type definitions and output json files that can be easily imported in our pages. Hot reloading comes out of the box, so edits to the markdown files will be reflected in the browser immediately!

## Pliny

A large reason for the popularity of the template was its customizability and integration with other services from analytics providers to commenting solutions. However, this means that a lot of boilerplate code has to be co-located within the template even if the user does not use the feature. Updates and bug fixes had to be copied manually to the user's codebase.

To solve this, I have abstracted the logic to a separate repository - [Pliny](https://github.com/timlrx/pliny). Pliny provides out of the box Next.js components to enhance static sites:

- Analytics
  - Google Analytics
  - Plausible Analytics
  - Simple Analytics
  - Umami Analytics
  - Posthog
- Comments
  - Disqus
  - Giscus
  - Utterances
- Newsletter (uses Next 13 API Routes)
  - Buttondown
  - Convertkit
  - Email Octopus
  - Klaviyo
  - Mailchimp
  - Revue
- Command palette search with tailwind style sheet
  - Algolia
  - Kbar (local search)
- UI utility components
  - Bleed
  - Newsletter / Blog Newsletter
  - Pre / Code block
  - Table of Contents

Choose your preferred service by modifying `siteMetadata.js` and changing the appropriate fields. For example to change from Umami Analytics to Plausible, we can change the following fields:

```diff-js:siteMetadata.js
analytics: {
-   umamiAnalytics: {
-     // We use an env variable for this site to avoid other users cloning our analytics ID
-     umamiWebsiteId: process.env.NEXT_UMAMI_ID, // e.g. 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
-   },
+    plausibleAnalytics: {
+      plausibleDataDomain: '', // e.g. tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app
+    },
},
```

[^1]: The previous version injects Preact into the production build. However, this is no longer possible as it does not support React Server Components. While overall bundle size has increased to about 85kB, most of the content can be pre-rendered on the server side, resulting in a low first contentful paint and time to interactive. Using React throughtout also leads to more consistent behavior with external libraries and components.
